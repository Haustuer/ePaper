* | File      	:   GUI_BMPfile.c
* | Author      :   Waveshare team
* | Function    :   Hardware underlying interface
* | Info        :
*                Used to shield the underlying layers of each master
*                and enhance portability
*----------------
* |	This version:   V2.0
* | Date        :   2018-11-12
* | Info        :
* 1.Change file name: GUI_BMP.c -> GUI_BMPfile.c
* 2.fix: GUI_ReadBmp()
*   Now Xstart and Xstart can control the position of the picture normally,
*   and support the display of images of any size. If it is larger than
*   the actual display range, it will not be displayed.
